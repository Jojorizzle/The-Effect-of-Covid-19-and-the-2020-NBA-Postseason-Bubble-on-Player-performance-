Introduction

In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the NBA 2019-20 regular season was suspended on March 11, 2020. In order to restart the season, in June the NBA decided to continue regular season play within an isolation zone (the bubble) at Walt Disney World in Florida. Twenty- two of the thirty NBA teams were invited to participate and the teams each played 8 games in order to determine playoff seeding. Once the seeds were determined, the 16 teams who advanced to the playoffs played through a standard NBA playoffs within the bubble with no fans in attendance. The bubble environment left a lot of questions to be asked in regard to player performance and how a closed off, zero fan attendance environment affects player performance. As the bubble games were taking place, analysts predicted that overall field goal, three point and free-throw percentages would all increase as a result of the bubble environment. I examine whether or not this analysis is accurate and whether or not the bubble really had a significant effect on these statistics. Using t-test analysis I find that the bubble provided a significant difference in player performance compared to the regular season. 

Data

The majority of the data needed for the study was all scraped from ESPN.com’s NBA section. Available on the website are player statistics, including both postseason and regular season for each NBA roster. Player statistics include 2019-20 season minutes played, points scored, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, true shooting percentage and PER (Player efficiency rating). Shooting statistics include field goal percentage, free throw percentage and three point percentage. It is agreed that true shooting percentage is the best shooting metric so both PER and true shooting percentage was scraped onto an xlsx file. The data was separated into two data sets; A data set containing stats from the 2020 ‘Bubble’ and a larger data set containing regular season stats from the 2003-2022 season. 

Methodology, Results and Interpretation 

Bubble Impact	
The goal of this study was to determine whether or not the NBA bubble had a significant effect on key shooting statistics and Player efficiency rating. NBA analysts and fans alike both suggested that the bubble environment would lead to a significant increase in overall shooting percentage and in the first couple weeks of play, this theory seemed to be correct. Analysts dubbed the NBA bubble to be an “offensive explosion” and equated the closed environment of the bubble to higher offensive production. Analysts even noted that historically after a season's stoppage, offensive numbers tend to dip leading to the question of “what makes the bubble different?”.



Another common theory among analysts was that since there was no crowd noise in the bubble environment, shooting would also significantly increase. This was due to distractions being eliminated and the free throw shooting environment being more controlled. 
This t- test analysis shows whether or not there was a significant difference in true shooting percentage as well as Player efficiency rating in the NBA bubble. 



As can be seen from the data,  there is a significant difference. This supports the speculation that shooting percentages would increase as a result of the bubble environment. 


Conclusions

Because of the unique NBA bubble environment, it is difficult to draw significant observations. The lack of data and the small sample size both contribute to that fact. Unfortunately, the plan for a bubble for the 2020-2021 NBA season fell through which would have given a fuller picture on whether or not the bubble truly has an effect on player performance.
However, as the pandemic continues and the possibility for another NBA bubble remains, there is hope for new conclusions to be drawn.
